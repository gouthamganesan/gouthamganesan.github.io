    <h4>Project Trainee</h4>
    <h5>Zoho Corp | Dec 2018 - Jun 2019</h5>

    <p>I got placed in the Product Management team of an up and coming enterprise SaaS product that makes enterprise IT
        administrators lives easier. I analysed customer queries, requests, and confusions, to understand the user pain
        points in the UI. Since I was relatively new, it also gave me an in-depth understanding of the overall workings
        of the product. Proceeding with the analysis and research, I got to synthesise the problems statements, and the
        requirements to address those scoped problems. </p>

    <p>During this time, I learned a lot about the importance of user centred design, and why understanding the user and
        their pain problems is very important.</p>

    <p>I also had the opportunity to talk with customers directly, to understand their problems. Preparing for this
        helped me understand that most customers have a solution mindset i.e. they tell what they want, and not what
        they go through i.e their actual problems. I learned thereâ€™s a big difference between those and how a product
        manager should strive to understand the root of their pain problems, before thinking about a solution.</p>
